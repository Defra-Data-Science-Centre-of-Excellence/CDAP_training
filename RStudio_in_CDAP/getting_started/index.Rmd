## About this guide  

### Who is this guide for?  

This guide is aimed at users who are familiar with R and RStudio, but new to CDAP.  


### What is this guide for?  

This user guide shows how to access RStudio from within the CDAP PROD environment, close RStudio, and access data from within CDAP.   


## Accessing RStudio on CDAP 

Within the workspace, click on Compute on the menu on the left.  



```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/image1.jpg", dpi = NA)
```



In the table that appears, click on RStudio.  


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/image2.png", dpi = NA)
```


  
In the horizontal menu, click on Apps.   


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/image3.png", dpi = NA)
```



Click on **Setup RStudio**. This will generate a password which you need to log into RStudio, alongside your Defra or ALB email address which is listed as your username. To copy the password, click on **show** which will reveal the password and copy it.  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/image4.jpg", dpi = NA)
```


  
Click on **Open RStudio**. Use your email address as the username to sign in to RStudio, and paste the password. This will take you to RStudio.  

## Quitting a session or signing out  


If you close the RStudio window but keep other tabs in the browser open, and then reopen RStudio through Databricks, your username and password will be saved and it takes you straight back to RStudio.  

To sign out of RStudio on CDAP, click on the **Sign out** icon next to your username at the top right hand side of your screen. You will need to enter your username and password again to get into RStudio, but your console and environment won't be cleared.  

If you click on the orange **Quit current R session** icon also at the top right, you will close the current session, including clearing your console and environment.  


## R version and packages  

The version of R that is available on CDAP depends on the runtime of Databricks that is being used at a given time. At the time of writing, the runtime is 10.4 LTS ML, which gives an R version of 4.1.2.  To check the current runtime, go back to Databricks to see the RStudio cluster, which tells you the runtime in the first tab.


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/image5.png", dpi = NA)
```


The R packages that are pre-installed also depend on the runtime. For a full list of packages, see the [release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/databricks/release-notes/runtime/10.4ml#r-libraries) of runtime 10.4 LTS ML.  

When the runtime of Databricks that is used in CDAP is updated, so will the list and versions of R packages.   

You can also install further packages yourself in the usual ways,  however, once you end the session, the package will no longer be available and you need to reinstall it at the next session. You can request for additional packages to be added more formally, so you don't have to reinstall them.  


## RStudio workspace on CDAP  

All of your projects, scripts and outputs are saved into your R workspace in CDAP. When you start, this space should be empty, but any files should appear there in the future. This space is separate from where data are hosted on CDAP in general, and it can only be accessed by you.  

**It is important that you back up any files you keep in your CDAP R workspace, and the recommendation is to do so using GitHub to host your code and outputs. Otherwise you may lose your work. Save any data in your folder in the lab zone as detailed below.**  


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/image6.jpg", dpi = NA)
```


## Accessing CDAP data from RStudio  


To see what data are held within CDAP, go out of RStudio back to Databricks, then click on **Data**. This will show you the Databricks File System (DBFS), where the data in CDAP are held. 


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/image7.png", dpi = NA)
```


Now click on DBFS at the top, then **mnt > migrated-landing > General Access**, and you can see some of the files that are held on CDAP. You can explore the other folders too.  



```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/image8.png", dpi = NA)
```



## Working with CDAP data in RStudio  


You can load data in the usual way, create an output, and save it into your personal files section. To load data from CDAP, the file path needs to start with **/dbfs/mnt/** and then the rest of the file path, see this example of loading data and creating a simple figure:  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## the tidyverse is pre-installed, so you can load it directly without installing it:
library(tidyverse) 

## Now load the data:
prices <- read_csv("/dbfs/mnt/landingr/General Access/AgriPricing/API-csv-10dec20.csv")

## Investigate the data:
head(prices)

## Create an output: 
ggplot(data = prices, aes(x = category, y = index)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()

## Save the output:
ggsave("figure1.png") 
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/image9.png", dpi = NA)
```

Since you haven't specified a particular place for the figure to be saved to, it should appear on the right under Files. You can also export files by ticking the box left to the file name, then More > Export..., and the file will be downloaded into your Downloads folder on your local machine.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/image10.jpg", dpi = NA)
```



  
## Uploading files into your RStudio workspace

You can upload your own files directly into your R workspace on CDAP. On the right hand side under Files, select Upload, and then find your local file to upload. It will appear under the R folder in Files.

Please do not use this option for data.
