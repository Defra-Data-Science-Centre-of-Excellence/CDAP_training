# CDAP training
Here you can find training materials for using the Common Data Analytics Platform (CDAP). These materials were created by members of the Data Analytics and Science Hub (DASH) in core Defra. Feedback is welcome!  

To get an overview of the CDAP platform, head to the [DASH SharePoint site](https://defra.sharepoint.com/sites/Community448/SitePages/CDAP-The-Common-Data-Analytics-Platform.aspx).  

If you are completely new to coding, you can get an overview of different coding languages through the Government Analysis Function [here](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/awareness-of-new-coding-tools/).

## Introduction to CDAP *still to be added*  

You can find a video showing how to access the platform through the browser [here](https://defra.sharepoint.com/sites/Community448/Comms/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FCommunity448%2FComms%2FRecordings%2FCDAP%5Fdemo%5FPart1%5Faccess%2Emp4&parent=%2Fsites%2FCommunity448%2FComms%2FRecordings&nav=%7B%22playbackOptions%22%3A%7B%22startTimeInSeconds%22%3A1%2E938248%7D%7D).  It contains:  
- Accessing Databricks notebooks  
- Accessing RStudio in CDAP  
- Databricks Filestore  

## [Databricks notebooks](https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/CDAP_demo_notebooks/tree/main/Databricks_notebooks)

You can find a video showing an example workflow in Databricks, using geospatial data from the governed data in CDAP to create a dashboard using Python, [here](https://defra.sharepoint.com/sites/Community448/Comms/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FCommunity448%2FComms%2FRecordings%2FCDAP%5Fdemo%5FPart2%5Fapples%5FTrim%2Emp4&parent=%2Fsites%2FCommunity448%2FComms%2FRecordings&nav=%7B%22playbackOptions%22%3A%7B%22startTimeInSeconds%22%3A0%2E95829%7D%7D).  

Here you can find demo and training notebooks that work in Databricks itself.  
- CDAP Demo - Data Combine (this is the notebook used in the videos linked above)   
- Data access user guide  
- ML flow and tensorboard user guide  

You can access the Databricks documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/databricks/).

To access Databricks Learning, follow the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/CDAP_training/blob/main/Databricks_notebooks/DEFRA%20-%20Free%20Learning%20Path%20Registration%20Instructions%20(1).pdf).

### Next steps with R and RStudio  


If you have used RStudio previously, the environment will look very familiar to you. If you are new to RStudio, we recommend you take a look at courses from the Government Analysis Function. There is a whole host of introductory courses including  
- [Introduction to R course](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/introduction-to-r/)    
- [Data visualisation in R and Python](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/data-visualisation-in-r-and-python/)  
- [Data linkage in R](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/data-linkage-in-r/)  
- [R control flow loops and functions](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/r-control-flow-loops-and-functions/)  
- [Data linkage in R](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/introduction-to-sparklyr/)   



There are also more advanced courses:  
- [Introduction to sparklyr](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/introduction-to-sparklyr/)  
- [Introduction to Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP)](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/introduction-to-reproducible-analytical-pipelines-rap/)
