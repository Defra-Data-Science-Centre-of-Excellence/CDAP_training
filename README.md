# CDAP training
Here you can find training materials for using the Common Data Analytics Platform (CDAP). These materials were created by members of the Data Analytics and Science Hub (DASH) in core Defra. Feedback is welcome!

## Introduction to CDAP *still to be added*  



## [Databricks notebooks](https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/CDAP_demo_notebooks/tree/main/Databricks_notebooks)

Here you can find demo and training notebooks that work in Databricks itself.  
- CDAP Demo - Data Combine   
- Data access user guide  
- ML flow and tensorboard user guide  

You can access the Databricks documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/databricks/).

### Next steps with R and RStudio  


If you have used RStudio previously, the environment will look very familiar to you. If you are new to RStudio, we recommend you take a look at courses from the Government Statistical Service. There is a whole host of introductory courses including  
- [Introduction to R course](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/training/introduction-to-r/)    
- [Data visualisation in R and Python](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/data-visualisation-in-r-and-python/)  
- [Data linkage in R](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/data-linkage-in-r/)  
- [R control flow loops and functions](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/r-control-flow-loops-and-functions/)  
- [Data linkage in R](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/introduction-to-sparklyr/)   



There are also more advanced courses:
