## What are Super Users

Some DASH users will be granted additional privileges to be able to spin up clusters. This is a guide contains instructions on how to do so as well as general advice.

Advice on spinning up personal compute clusters from databricks can be found here:

## Init scripts

A separate GitHub repository contains init scripts to be used on DH cluster.
