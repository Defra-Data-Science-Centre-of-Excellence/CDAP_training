## What are Super Users and can they do

Some DASH users will be granted additional privileges to be able to spin up clusters, those are denoted as *Super Users*. They are there to facilitate their teams' work as different analysis teams have different computing needs that potentially need bespoke configurations. Please remember that cluster creation is a *privilege*, not a right; if someone abuses it, it will be taken away.

Here is some general advice on how to manage a cluster:

-   Best practices on cluster configuration can be found here: [Best practices: Cluster configuration - Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/databricks/clusters/cluster-config-best-practices). Please read them before continuing.

-   Best practices on spinning up personal compute clusters from Databricks can be found here: [Create a Personal Compute resource - Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/databricks/clusters/personal-compute), they complement the previous point.

-   Please select the smallest VM you can perform your work with. A rule of thumb: E-series VMs are good for R based analytics. Information about VM types can be found here: [Virtual Machine series \| Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/series/).

-   You are strongly discouraged of using GPUs clusters unless you need them. They are very expensive.

DASH Support will be happy to discuss with you how to tailor your cluster configuration.

## Init scripts

A separate GitHub repository contains init scripts that can be used during DASH cluster creation.\
[DASH Init scripts](https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/init-scripts). General information about init scripts can be found in [What are init scripts?](https://docs.databricks.com/en/init-scripts/index.html). There is also an older user guide with some useful background available [here](https://defra-data-science-centre-of-excellence.github.io/CDAP_training/ini_scripts_guide/).
