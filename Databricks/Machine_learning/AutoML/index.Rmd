## What is AutoML?

"Databricks AutoML allows you to quickly generate baseline models and notebooks. ML experts can accelerate their workflow by fast-forwarding through the usual trial-and-error and focus on customizations using their domain knowledge, and citizen data scientists can quickly achieve usable results with a low-code approach."
