## What can be published from RStudio server?

Shiny dashboards as well as R Markdown and bookdown files can be published directly from RStudio server.  
The below process will use the example Shinny dashboard in RStudio. The same process would be followed for other types of files to be published.
  
There is a 2GB limit to the size of dashboards that can be published on the Posit server.

## Creating a dashboard
  
First access RStudio from the DASH Platform. Once in RStudio go to file and click on **Shiny Web App**

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '200%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Dashboard1.png", dpi = NA)

```

From this give the dashboard a name and click **Create**

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '200%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Dashboard2.png", dpi = NA)

```

## COnnect to Posit server

Next go to the top right of the window and click **Publish Application**

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '200%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Dashboard3.png", dpi = NA)

```

If you haven't already connected to RStudio Connect then a window will pop up prompting you to connect. Click **Next** on this window

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '200%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Dashboard3.png", dpi = NA)

```

Click **RStudio Connect**

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '200%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Dashboard5.png", dpi = NA)

```

Enter this URL into the box: https://dap-prd2-connect.azure.defra.cloud/ and click **Next**

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '200%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Dashboard6.png", dpi = NA)

```

Another window will pop up prompting you to connect to R. Click on **Connect**

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '200%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Dashboard7.png", dpi = NA)

```

Next re-enter your credentials and log in.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '200%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Dashboard8.png", dpi = NA)

```

Another window will pop up saying 'Connection succeeded'. Close this window

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '200%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Dashboard9.png", dpi = NA)

```

On the next window click **Connect Account**

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '200%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Dashboard10.png", dpi = NA)

```

## Publish Dashboard

Now click **Publish**

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '200%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Dashboard11.png", dpi = NA)

```

If this screen appears just click **Try Again**

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '200%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Dashboard12.png", dpi = NA)

```

Now you will have your dashboard displayed in Posit

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '200%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Dashboard13.png", dpi = NA)

```

By default The dashboard can only be accessed by the publisher.
Please view the Dashboard_admin to set access rights.  
  
If you have problem publishing your own dashboard please view the Publishing_troubleshooting_documentation.
