## Creating a dashboard

This guide will not cover how to create a dashboard. More information can be
found on the plotly dash website and courses can be found on Datacamp.
You may want to try this with a simple dashboard first.  
  
A simple hello world example:

```
from dash import Dash, html

app = Dash(__name__)

app.layout = html.Div([
    html.Div(children='Hello World')
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Save this as app.py


You will also have to install "rsconnect" to publish the dashboard.
