## What is Visual Studio Code?

"Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET)"

## DASH implamentation

VSCode is currently supported through Azure Virtual Destop (AVD).  
A Databricks plugin is available for VSCode to connect to DASH clusters.

## Launching VSCode

Once logged into a virtual desktop, VSCode is installed an can be opened like any other application.
There is guidance on how to set up the Databricks plugin. 
Once installed and set up it will be available for use on subsequent launches of the application.
